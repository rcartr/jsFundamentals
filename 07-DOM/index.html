    <title>Intro to DOM Manipulation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- 
        DOM is short for Document Object Model 
        It is what allows JS to interact with our HTML and CSS. The DOM specifies how a browser should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser's window.

        DOM is an object representation of a web page, which can be modified with a scripting language like JavaScript.

        Two primary functions:
        1. Making a model of an HTML page
            - When the browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of the page in memory.
            - The DOM specifies the way in which a browser should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree. The DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree is made of objects.
        2. Accessing and changing the HTML page
            - The DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.

        Usually when working with DOM, we will access an element we want to work with and then we will modify or manipulate it.

        ACCESSING:
            Common methods for accessing a single element:
            - getElementByID()
            - querySelector()

            Common methods for accessing multiple elements:
            - querySelectorAll()
            - getElementByClassName()
            - getElementByTagName()
        
        MANIPULATING:
            Common methods for working with HTML content:
            - innerHTML (a property)
            - textContent
            - createElement

            Common methods for working with tab attributes:
            - className / id
            - setAttribute()
            - getAttribute()

        We can write JS directly in our HTML using the <script> tag
            Similar to how we can write CSS in out HTML using <style> tag
            -->
            <script>
                //  now we can write some JS
                console.log('Hello from the script tag!')
                </script>
        <!-- To link an external JS file, we still use the <script> tag, but specifiy a source -->
            <script src="script.js"></script>
