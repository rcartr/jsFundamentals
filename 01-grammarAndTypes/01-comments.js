// A single line comment

// using "//" will comment out a single line, making this useful for notes

// We can use "ctrl + /" (on Windows) or "CMD + /" (on Mac) as a shortcut to make a comment.

/* Multi-Line Comments

/*
Using a / and *
will create
a new multi-line
comment
*/

// In VSCode, our shortcut to make a comment will also work within CSS or HTML in the same way, 
// though the syntax will be slightly different.

/* Comments are ignored when running code, anything inside them will not be run, whether it is valid code or otherwise. This makes commenting code very useful when debugging.
